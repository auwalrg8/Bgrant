# Bgrant
Bgrant is a Bitcoin-native web application designed to streamline the discovery, application, and tracking of grants for open-source (OSS) Bitcoin developers, with a primary focus on underserved African talent. In an ecosystem where funding opportunities are fragmented (e.g., Btrust's Builders Cohort, HRF's Bitcoin Development Fund), Bgrant acts as a centralized, privacy-preserving portal that reduces application friction and enhances transparency through on-chain proofs and Nostr integrations.
